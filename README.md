# Github Protocol
For keeping it clean...
- "git fetch" as much as possible
- "git pull" before you upload any code you've made
- "git push" when you want to upload your code or you're at a good stopping spot that will not affect others who try to run your code
- LEAVE COMMENTS!! Especially when you leave something partly completed or you implement something complicated. Other people will be looking at what you're writing, and they may be adding things that interact with your code.
