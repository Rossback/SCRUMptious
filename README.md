# **SCRUMptious**

**Git Repo for team Scrumptious in CS 361 at Oregon State University!**

## Github Protocol

### How to update your local repo to include main changes, in this order

1. First, `git pull origin main`
2. Next, `git merge main`
3. Finally and optionally, `git fetch`
    - Always use frequently if you're working on a branch with someone else

### How to handle making changes

- Make a branch with a name that tells others what is being changed
- If you are making changes on multiple things or features, list them in your Pull Request
- Try to use one branch for one topic/feature/change
- Add comments so others can understand what your code does

### How to make pull requests

1. Save your changes to a new branch, those branch protocols are listed above
2. Create a Pull Request with a description that says everything you changed, especially if your branch name does not describe all your changes
3. Message other people about your Pull Request so others can comment/approve/request changes to your request
    - You can request specific people to review your Pull request, which is recommended if you change something on a feature that someone else has worked on previously
4. If changes are approved and merged onto the main branch, ensure the old branch is DELETED AND NOT COMMITED TO EVER AGAIN! This is to ensure the cleanliness of the repo
