# Github Protocol
For keeping it clean...
- "git fetch" as much as possible
- "git pull main" to pull main for merging on your machine
- "git push" when you want to upload your code or you're at a good stopping spot
- "git merge main" for when you need to combine something that happened on main into your current working branch
- LEAVE COMMENTS!! Especially when you leave something partly completed or you implement something complicated. Other people will be looking at what you're writing, and they may be adding things that interact with your code.
